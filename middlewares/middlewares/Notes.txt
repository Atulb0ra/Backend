receives the rquest and before the response is sent to the client.

middleware are used for :
1 -> middleware chaining --->call the next middleware in the chain.
2 -> end the request response cycle --> middleware used to send response before
 the actual response is sent to the client
3->execute any code
4->make chaanges to the request or response objects.
